# LEGO-Dateset-Analysis
we're going to be diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO, which will help us answer a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:

1.What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

2.In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

3.Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?

4.When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?

5.Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?
